# Email

Istota polls an IMAP inbox for incoming messages and sends replies via SMTP.

## Receiving email

The email poller checks the configured IMAP folder (default: `INBOX`) at regular intervals. Routing precedence for incoming mail:

1. **Recipient plus-address**: `bot+user_id@domain` routes directly to the specified user
2. **Sender match**: sender email matched against user `email_addresses` config
3. **Thread match**: `References` header matched against `sent_emails` table (emissary thread replies)

Attachments are downloaded to `/Users/{user_id}/inbox/`.

### Email confirmation gate

Emails from untrusted senders require explicit user confirmation before processing. This applies to:

- Plus-addressed emails (`bot+user_id@domain`) from senders not in the user's trusted list
- Emails whose `From:` names one of the user's own addresses, when `confirm_sender_match` is enabled (default: false)

When an email is gated, a confirmation prompt is posted to the user's alerts channel (Talk) asking them to approve, discard, or — for an external sender — trust them so later mail passes. Trusted senders bypass the gate.

Thread-matched emails (emissary replies) are never gated — the external contact holds a `Message-ID` from mail the bot sent on the user's behalf, and that is the routing evidence.

### `confirm_sender_match`

Off by default, and worth understanding before turning it on. The bot normally treats a `From:` matching one of the user's `email_addresses` as proof the user sent the mail. SMTP `From:` is unauthenticated, so it is a claim anyone who knows the address can make. This flag stops the claim counting as evidence: mail arriving with the user's own address on it is held until they approve it from Talk, a channel the sender cannot reach. The cost is that the user's own mail to the bot is held too — nothing in a plain SMTP message distinguishes the two.

The flag applies to whichever route the mail takes, not only to sender-match routing. Routing is decided by the recipient first, and the plus-address is public — it is the `From:` on every message the bot sends on the user's behalf — so a sender who knows the address the gate is about also knows how to arrive as a plus-addressed message instead. The same claim gets the same answer either way. Mail from a genuinely external sender is unaffected by the flag; it is gated or not on the existing plus-address rule.

Two escape hatches keep it usable. An address listed in the user's `trusted_email_senders` is exempt outright, and `!trust <address>` adds one at runtime. Both are deliberate grants rather than the header trusting itself — but an address trusted either way is then trusted for anyone who can spoof it, so a deployment that turns the flag on for the spoofing protection should not immediately trust its way back out of it. For that reason the confirmation prompt for a self-claim offers only `yes` and `no`; the `yes trust` shortcut is offered only for genuinely external senders, where trusting them costs nothing this gate protects.

Two limits to know. An unanswered confirmation is auto-cancelled after `scheduler.confirmation_timeout_minutes`, so leaving the flag on with no watched Talk channel drops inbound mail rather than queuing it (an undeliverable prompt is logged as a warning). And attachments are downloaded to the user's `inbox/` before the gate runs, so declining a message holds its *processing* — the attached files have already landed and are not removed.

Trusted senders are configured at two levels:

- **Config-time**: `trusted_email_senders` in per-user config (supports fnmatch patterns like `*@company.com`)
- **Runtime**: managed via Talk commands

```
!trust sender@example.com     # add trusted sender
!untrust sender@example.com   # remove trusted sender
!trust                         # list all trusted senders
```

Runtime trusted senders are stored in the database and checked alongside config-time patterns.

### Suspicious email alerts

During task execution, if the agent detects suspicious content in an email (social engineering, prompt injection, exfiltration attempts), it writes an alert to a deferred JSON file. After task completion, the scheduler posts these alerts to the user's alerts channel in Talk.

## Sending email

Outbound emails use SMTP. The `SMTP_FROM` address is plus-addressed as `bot+user_id@domain` so replies route back to the correct user.

Email output uses a deferred file pattern: Claude writes a JSON file to the temp dir, and the scheduler sends the email after task completion.

## Emissary threads

When the bot sends an email on behalf of a user, the outbound message is tracked in the `sent_emails` table (Message-ID, recipient, user, conversation_token, plus an origin descriptor recording the surface+channel the thread started on). When external contacts reply, the email poller matches `References` headers against sent emails and creates a task routed by the user's `email_reply_routing` policy:

- `origin+thread` (default) — deliver the reply to the conversation's origin surface (`web` / `talk` / etc.) **and** mirror it back over email to the thread.
- `origin` — origin surface only.
- `thread` — email thread only.

The origin descriptor self-addresses the surface and channel, so a reply to a web-started thread lands back in the right web room rather than defaulting to Talk. Replies whose origin can't be recovered (plus-address / sender-match paths with no descriptor) fall back to the user's resolved Talk room.

The bot drafts a response and asks for confirmation. On approval, the task re-executes with `confirmation_context` injected, instructing it to send the draft rather than re-draft. Pending confirmations are auto-cancelled when the user sends a new message in the same conversation.

## Configuration

```toml
[email]
enabled = true
imap_host = "imap.example.com"
imap_port = 993
imap_user = "istota@example.com"
imap_password = "app-password-here"
smtp_host = "smtp.example.com"
smtp_port = 587
# smtp_user = ""      # defaults to imap_user
# smtp_password = ""  # defaults to imap_password
poll_folder = "INBOX"
bot_email = "istota@example.com"
```

SMTP credentials fall back to IMAP credentials if not set.

Polling interval is controlled by `email_poll_interval` in `[scheduler]` (default 60s). Old processed emails are cleaned after `email_retention_days` (default 7).

### Per-user email settings

```toml
# [users.alice] block in config.toml — DB row populated by `istota user ensure` wins
email_addresses = ["alice@example.com"]
trusted_email_senders = ["*@company.com", "boss@other.com"]
alerts_channel = "room789"  # Talk room for confirmations/alerts
```
