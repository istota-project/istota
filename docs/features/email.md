# Email

Istota polls an IMAP inbox for incoming messages and sends replies via SMTP.

## Receiving email

The email poller checks the configured IMAP folder (default: `INBOX`) at regular intervals. Routing precedence for incoming mail:

1. **Recipient plus-address**: `bot+user_id@domain` routes directly to the specified user
2. **Sender match**: sender email matched against user `email_addresses` config
3. **Thread match**: `References` header matched against `sent_emails` table (emissary thread replies)

Attachments are downloaded to `/Users/{user_id}/inbox/`.

## Sending email

Outbound emails use SMTP. The `SMTP_FROM` address is plus-addressed as `bot+user_id@domain` so replies route back to the correct user.

Email output uses a deferred file pattern: Claude writes a JSON file to the temp dir, and the scheduler sends the email after task completion.

## Emissary threads

When the bot sends an email on behalf of a user, the outbound message is tracked in the `sent_emails` table (Message-ID, recipient, user, conversation_token). When external contacts reply, the email poller matches `References` headers against sent emails and creates tasks with `output_target="talk"` routed to the originating Talk conversation.

The bot drafts a response and asks for confirmation. On approval, the task re-executes with `confirmation_context` injected, instructing it to send the draft rather than re-draft. Pending confirmations are auto-cancelled when the user sends a new message in the same conversation.

## Configuration

```toml
[email]
enabled = true
imap_host = "imap.example.com"
imap_port = 993
imap_user = "istota@example.com"
imap_password = "app-password-here"
smtp_host = "smtp.example.com"
smtp_port = 587
# smtp_user = ""      # defaults to imap_user
# smtp_password = ""  # defaults to imap_password
poll_folder = "INBOX"
bot_email = "istota@example.com"
```

SMTP credentials fall back to IMAP credentials if not set.

Polling interval is controlled by `email_poll_interval` in `[scheduler]` (default 60s). Old processed emails are cleaned after `email_retention_days` (default 7).
